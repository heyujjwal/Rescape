# Rescape
This project considers several instances of abstraction that arose in the design and implementation of our web application. It's our general observation that, 'creating a Resume is a bit tedious task for any student or even for working professionals. The general purpose of this web application is to build a Resume/CV according to the need of a person, that simplifies the task for an individual. The system is flexible to be used and it reduces the need of thinking and designing an appropriate Resume according to the qualifications. 
The dimension of thought in the building of Rescape is totally different and even more convenient than the other Resume/CV making sites. While making this project we tried our best and even got successful also to figure out the general aspects of any user for making any kind of Resume/CV. We found that data inserted in any template of the Resume is fixed while template is not. So, we approached with this way of solving our users problem. 
So, for making our Web Application we have used a good and efficient knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also extensively used React.js as our frountend framework.
